This dupe is the disconnect dupe, what you do is you must join a paper or based server (ex spigot, folia) and hold the item you want to dupe, then crouch and press Q at the same time, and the mod will time the disconnect. Just wait a second before you rejoin and there should be the item on the floor aswell as on your inventory

This is a very serious exploit and should only be used by very serious people who have very serious goals.
This exploit has taken months of time and development to make, and is not to be tampered with lightly.
