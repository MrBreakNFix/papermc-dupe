# What is this?
This is a very serious exploit and should only be used by very serious people who have very serious goals. This exploit has taken months of time and development to make, and is not to be tampered with lightly.

# How does it work?
By exploiting an oversight in the paper server software, we are able to desync the client and server’s item pickup timers, resulting in a race condition that happens to duplicate your items when you join back.


— To be honest, this is probably the most ballin exploit that I've ever made. it’s basically my magnum opus, better than the *te*es my uncle used to sell and more rich than the *mu*esli my grandmother used to make me. this exploit goes harder than a nokia, seriously, that’s how good this exploit is. —
